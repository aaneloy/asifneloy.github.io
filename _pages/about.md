<h3>Website Under Reconstruction, Will Update Soon</h3>

<br/>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Asif Ahmed Neloy is a <b>Business & Data Science</b> professional specializing in Machine Learning, passionate about uncovering insights from complex data. With a <b>Master of Science</b> degree in Computer Science from the <b>University of Manitoba</b>, Asif has extensive experience in machine learning tools, including data structures, clustering and classification, natural language processing, and unravelling business decisions. 

<br/>
<br/>

Asif's multidisciplinary research area encompasses a broad domain of <b>Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning</b>. He is particularly interested in problems related to <b>Probabilistic</b> and <b>Bayesian Modeling</b>, <b>Anomaly Detection</b>, <b>Dimension Reduction</b>, and interdisciplinary applications of <b>Auto-Encoders</b>. Currently, Asif is working on modelling Auto-Encoders and algorithms related to <b>Variational and Gaussian modelling </b>. Part of his research focuses on Statistical interpretation and visualization of Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms for dimension reduction and anomaly detection. Also, Asif is designing interactive Python packages for Data Engineering, such as Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Model Interpretation, Selecting Data Scalers, and Statistical Analysis. Some of his Python Packages can be found <b><a href="https://pypi.org/user/aaneloy/" target="_blank">here</a></b>.
